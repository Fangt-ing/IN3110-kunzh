## Task 4.0

* manual_timing_.py runs the test of functions from test_slow_rectangle.py, each function is runned for 5 times. The time consumed by each run of coresponding function is saved to manual_report.txt.

* timeit_timing_.py runs the test of functions from test_slow_rectangle.py, each function is runned for 5 times.  In the meantime, it compares the time of coresponding function at each round to the ones in manual_timing_.py. The time consumed by each run of coresponding function and comparisons are saved to timeit_report.txt.

* cProfile_timing_.py compares the slowest function runned by using 2 different menthod defined in manual_timing_.py and timeit_timing_.py. Sata is saved to cProfile_report.txt.

## Task 4.1

The python_color2gray.py file takes in an image with extension of '.jpg, '.png', '.jpeg', '.bmp'. Then converts the image file to a grayed image, together it generates a report includes the following:
